# DeepFake Audio Detection using TSSD with Attention Mechanism

As Deepfake technology advances, audio-based forgeries pose significant threats to digital security, including voice impersonation, misinformation, and fraud. This project aims to tackle these challenges by developing a robust deep learning model capable of distinguishing between real and synthetic audio.

## Project Overview

This system leverages a **Time Domain Synthetic Speech Detection (TSSD)** model integrated with an **Attention Mechanism** to enhance focus on key audio features. The model is trained on benchmark datasets and achieves high accuracy in classifying real and fake audio.

## üéØ Objective

To build an advanced audio deepfake detection system that accurately identifies manipulated audio using time-series deep learning techniques and attention-based mechanisms.

## Features

- **TSSD Architecture**: Designed for effective temporal feature extraction from audio signals  
- **Attention Mechanism**: Improves model sensitivity to critical audio frames  
- **MFCC Feature Extraction**: Captures spectral patterns relevant for classification  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **98.20%** accuracy in internal evaluations  
- **Real-time Prediction Support**: Frontend interface for audio upload and detection using Flask

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**, **NumPy**, **Librosa** ‚Äì for preprocessing and feature extraction  
- **PyTorch** ‚Äì for model building and training  
- **Flask** ‚Äì for creating the web interface  
- **HTML** ‚Äì frontend integration  

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Real audio clips**: 10,000 samples from public speech datasets  
- **Fake audio clips**: 10,000 clips generated using TTS models like WaveNet  
- Clips are 2‚Äì3 seconds long WAV files
